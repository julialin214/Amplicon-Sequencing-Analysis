# Amplicon Sequencing Analysis 

### `sequence_counter.py`
Counts unique sequences across multiple FASTQ files. The script processes a list of FASTQ inputs, extracts sequences based on specified 5' and 3' constant regions, and filters them by a defined variable region length range. It outputs a CSV file with the counts of each unique sequence across all input files.
